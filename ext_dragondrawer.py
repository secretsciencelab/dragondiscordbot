DIO: You're next, Jotaro!



JOTARO: You bastard. DIO!



DIO: Oh? You're approaching me? Instead of running away, you're coming right to me?

Even Though your grandfather, Joseph, told you the secret of The World, *dead Joseph pics*

like an exam student scrambling to finish the problems on an exam until the last moments

before the chime?



JOTARO: I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer.



DIO: Oh ho! Then come as close as you like.

*ta zajebista scena z mangi co tak do siebie podchodza*



JOTARO: Ora!



DIO: Too slow, too slow! The World is the ultimate Stand. Even without his power to stop

time, his speed and power far exceed that of your Star Platinum.



JOTARO: So it's the same type of Stand as Star Platinum. Not much range, but immense power

and precise movements.



DIO: I wanted to try a little test to find out just how much more powerful The World was,

compared to your Stand.

DIO: Though it appears a test was hardly necessary.



JOTARO: Test? Is that what you call just patting me, and not even enough to hurt?

JOTARO: Well, i guess you ripped my 20,000 yen pants, though.



DIO: Why are you Joestars so stubborn about admitting defeat?

DIO: Hmph. I suppose I shall rise to your shilly provocation, and test you just a bit more.

*The World wali piachy na standa Jotaro*

*Jotaro zadrapuje policzek Dio*

*Muda muda vs Ora Ora*



DIO: So my The World's power and precision are both superior! I've seen enough. I'm satisfied.

I will end you now!

DIO: I have decided that I will show no mercy when fighting one of the Joestar bloodline,

but will kill them instantly!

*ora ora ora ora*

DIO: The way to end you is with The World's true power!

*ZA WARUDO! TOKI WO TOMARE!*



DIO: With this, the Joestar bloodline will finally end. My archenemies, who dared to make

an appearance in my destiny.. Farewell!

*Jotaro rucha paluchem*



DIO: Wha- What? He just moved! He... Impossible!

DIO: His finger just moved! I-it can't be. It can't be! They're.. the same?

DIO: *in głowa: The World and Star Platinum are the same type of Stand?!*

DIO: Can he see me? Or is he moving his hand subconsciously?

DIO: *oh* Time's up.

*Czas jest unstopped now*



DIO: Could you see me? I ASKED IF YOU COULD SEE ME, JOTARO!



JOTARO: Who knows? I don't know what you're talking about, Dio.



DIO: Very well! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter if you can see me during stopped time or not!

DIO: If you can move the same way as my The World, let me see you moving!

DIO: I, DIO, had truly surpassed all forms of life and all Stands! And now, I can stop

time for five seconds, and longer and longer intervals each time!

DIO: Jotaro! I shall see just how powerful you truly are!

* ZA WARUDO! TOMERE TOKI WO! *

*DIO SEE MAGNES PIERDOLONY IN REKA*



DIO: ahahhahHAHAHAHAHAhHhhHahahahahh! (beczka ogolnie)

DIO: You had placed that magnet on me.

DIO: When we were testing each other's strength earlier? It looks like a magnet taken from a

wallet or pocket planner.

DIO: You completely fooled me. I can't take my eyes off you for a second. But! If you're using

a trick like this, that proves you can't move during stopped time! You only added a few more seconds

to your life! This time, you will..

DIO: DIE, JOTARO!

*jotaro napierdala piensc w brzuch The World's i go rozpierdala*



DIO: NAAANIII! H-he.. really can move! Only for a moment, but he can move!

DIO: The magnet wasn't to trick me into thinking he could move... But to trick me into thinking

he couldn't, and lure me closer!

*jotaro punches him wery hart i rozbija sie dio o witryne sklepowa*

*noga odpierdolona - podaj mi noge suko*



JOTARO: I could move for a moment.. Just a moment. But..

JOTARO: Yare yare daze.

JOTARO: It was only enough to get one punch in.



DIO: You. Woman.

DIO: Fetch my leg from over there. HURRY UP AND FETCH IT! BEHAVE LIKE A FLIGHT ATTENDANT,

BRINGING A DRINK AND CAVIAR TO A FIRST-CLASS PASSENGER!

JOTARO: I guess I have to bash your head to pieces, or it'll be like nothing ever happened. You've

already recovered your energy. Because that hole i put in your gut is closed up now.

*teleportuje sie za jotaro*



DIO: Your eyes followed me in the world of stopped time.. So you truly can see my movements, Jotaro.



JOTARO: Seems so.



DIO: Kakyoin did quite well for you. Because he figured out the secret of The World's powers, you were able

to figure out that you could move during stopped time, and so, you were able to invade my world.

*nando speedo teleportation*



DIO: Which makes me think.. Just how long can you move within my world of stopped time?

DIO: Two seconds? Three? Or perhaps you can move five seconds, just like me, and you're just pretending that you

can't? And so on.

DIO: Well? How about it?



*jotaro mozg*- This isn't good. I could move longer with some practice, but right now, a moment

is the best I can do.*



DIO: I believe that you can only move for a moment now. But since you have invaded my world of stopped time, it would

not be wise to underestimate you by getting close. Even when i still have an overwhelming adventage.

DIO: THEREFORE, JOTARO, I'VE DECIDED HOW TO KILL YOU SUCH THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG YOU CAN MOVE!

*wyciaga te noze, jotaro wystraszony*



DIO: You've gone pale. When you saw these knives, you realized that you facce a more horrific fate than that geezer Joseph.



JOTARO: *Bastard! How the hell does he come up with stuff like this? He's dangerous.*

*jotaro use secret Joestar technikue



DIO: You cannot escape!

DIO: ZA WARUDO!

DIO: Five more seconds!

*rzuca nozyki*



DIO: Once time begins to move again, I wonder if even your Star Platinum can manage to deflect so many knives.

*rzuca następne noze*



DIO: Four more seconds!

*ta smieszna pozycja co stoi w nozach i sie smieje |HAHAHhahahahahHAHhHhah|*



DIO: Being able to see this must be all the more terrifying, Jotaro!

DIO: Three more seconds..

*rzuca noze a star platinum je odbija*



DIO: Just two more seconds.. Is that all you can do? This proves that you really can move only

for a moment.

DIO: One more second..

DIO: Zero.

*czas plynie znowu star platinum odbije noze lecz jotaro i tak dostaje na klate*

DIO: It's over. I'll add one more, just to be sure.

*dio throw pierdolony nozyk into jotaro head*



DIO: To be frank, I'm relieved that I could defeat you so quickly, Jotaro.

DIO: I never thought you would be able to enter my stopped time. As i see it, those machines known as

automobiles are useful devices, but because everyone has one, the streets become too crowded.

*jotaro upada poraz pierwszy (jak jezusek lol)*



DIO: Only I, DIO, should have power over stopped time.



JOTARO: Yare yare daze.. Throwing all those knives.. Now my valuable uniform is full of holes.

*mozg jotaro- I stuffed my clothes with magazines just in case he tried throwing anything..

But i didn't think he'd throw that many knives at me. Playing dead and waiting for a chance

to strike is the best chance i have right now. I need to figure out how to knock off his head..

Otherwise, he won't die.*

*Dio skacze przed niego - staje obok znaku drogowego*



DIO: I'd better play it safe. The Joestar bloodline has proven itself rather lucky. He might be trying

to trick me by playing dead. I must end him beyond a shadow of a doubt!

DIO: By..

*odcina znak*

DIO: Chopping his head off with this!

DIO: This is truly the end for you, JOTARO!

*nagle za plecami skacze Lil Pol Pol i przebija Dio głowe*



POLNAREFF: Die, DIO!

*czas sie zatrzymuje*



DIO: The World! Time has stopped..

DIO: So it's you, Polnareff?

*punches pol pol in brzuch*



DIO: And time will move once more.

*Polnareff uderza o sciane na pelnej pizdzie*



DIO: Too bad, Polnareff. With just a moment more, and with just a tiny bit more force,

you could have torn my brain apart with your rapier.



POLNAREFF: B-Bastard! This is impossible..



DIO: You cannot assassinate DIO.

*tutaj to zdjecie jak caly zolty stoi ze znakiem w rece*



DIO: Joestar's Egyptian tour group will be no more, once i finish you.



*jotaro mozg- Damn it. Polnareff'q going to get killed. I wanted to play dead as long as possible,

until I could land a blow to his head, but.. It would be easy for me to keep Polnareff's head

on his shoulders.*

*dalej jotaro mozg tylko inna linijka- But Dio won't enter Star Platinum's attack range.

It'll end up like it did last time. I have to make sure he doesn't realize I'm alive. As long

as he doesn't know for sure, my chance to get close to him will come.*

*ciag dalszy mozg- Talk about irony. I tried my hardest to move inside his stopped time, but now I

have to try my hardest to stay completely still.*



DIO: Farewell, Polnareff!

*jotaro drapie ziemie (wiecie o co mi chodzi) *

*dio wyskakuje do tylu i obserwuje jotaro*



DIO: Jotaro, you.. You're alive.. or you're coming around.

*policjant wycelowywuje bron w dio*



POLICJANCI: Dont move! We're the police! We have guns pointed at you! Put your hands up slowly.

* dio teleportuje sie za policjantow i uderza jednego w twarz*



DIO: All right. Perfect timing. There's something I'd like you to shoot with that gun. Shoot the man

lying on the ground over there. You can shoot his leg, his torse.. Whatever you like.

DIO: Come on. Be sure not to miss.

*policjant wystrzeliwuje w jotaro ale star platinum lapie pocisk palcami pod kurtka*



DIO: Perhaps I was just imagining that sound I thought I heard coming from Jotaro.



*jotaro mozg- What a sick thing to do.. But now Dio's attention is on me, not Polnareff. Right now,

he's suspicious as all hell. He'll try to make absolutely sure that I'm dead. This is when

things get really dangerous.*



DIO: The sound of his breathing.. I don't hear it. He's not breathing. Then what about his heartbeat?

*jotaro lapie sie za serce przy pomocy star platinum by zatrzymac prace kurwa serce*

*dio nasluchuje z uchem przy ziemi*



*jotaro mozg- This is damn tough.. If i black out, I really will die. It won't even be funny..

If i die because I used my Stand to stop my own heart.. *

*dio przestaje sluchac*



DIO: his heart isn't breathing. He is definitely dead. I thought he was still alive, but it was just my imagination.

*podnosi znak*



DIO: Just in case, I'll lop off his head so that I can truly rest at ease.

DIO: ALL RIGHT, JOTARO?

*jotaro przyśpiesza prace serca przy pomocy star platinum*

*dio bierze zamach by odjebac mu leb ale ten lamie znak*



DIO: What?!

*jotaro bierze rozmach (star platinum)*



DIO: Stop time! The Worl..

*jotaro wali mu hita na leb i rozpierdala czache*



JOTARO: I went through hell there.. But even if you stop time, I'm still going to blow your

head off, Dio.



DIO: Wh-What? It can't be..



JOTARO: ORA!

*dio uderza o schody*



JOTARO: Finally.. Finally, I was able to bash his head in. But that bastard Dio is a monster

who survived a hundred years at the bottom of the ocean. I can't believe he's dead yet.

JOTARO: It's too soon to relax.



DIO: I'll kill you..

*dio wywraca sie i krwawi leżąc*



DIO: Wh-What is this? Impossible! M-my legs..

DIO: I can't move my legs. I can't stand!~

*jotaro rozjebuje bak samochodu i nalewa paliwo do wiader*



DIO: I have a headache.. a-and nausea..

DIO: How could this happen? Me, Dio, feeeling sick?

DIO: My head's been destroyed, so I can't get up?! Damn it! I have to do something!

*jotaro oblewa dio paliwem*



JOTARO: I covered you with gasoline so I can track your smell. I feel bad, kicking a guy when

he's down, but..

JOTARO: Nah. I don't feel bad about this at all.

*wyciąga zapalniczke*



JOTARO: My friends and a lot of innocent bystanders are dead because of you.

*odpala zapalniczke*



DIO: HahahahahHAHhhhHHahHAHAhahaaaAAAAA

DIO: ZA WARUDO!

DIO: If i can.. If I can get to that place..

*czołga się i łapie zderzak samochodu*



DIO: Time.. Time will move once more.

*jadzie złapany za zderzak*

*zajebisty soundtrack zaczyna grać*



JOTARO: He put his ear to the ground to listen for cars coming near.

JOTARO: But..

*wyciaga noz z reki*



JOTARO: I can't let him get away!

*rzuca i trafia w opone samochodu, dio wyrzucony w powietrze ląduje obok wejścia do ścieków (to kolko)*



DIO: That place.. That place!

DIO: If I can just get there..

*unosi kolko ze stodzienki sciekowej*

*jotaro jest w srodku*



JOTARO: This place is taken. You can't escape.

*jotaro powoli wylatuje*



JOTARO: Give up, Dio.



DIO: The World! Sto-



JOTARO: ORA!

JOTARO: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!

JOTARO: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!

*dio wylatuje w powietrze i leci na koniec ulicy*

*edgy badass jotaro face*



DIO: You fell for it, JOTARO! This is my escape route!

DIO: You have lost in the battle of wits against me, DIO!

DIO: Doesn't this street look familiar?



JOTARO: This street.. I-It can't be..

*dio ssie krew z Josepha*



DIO: That's right. It was my escape route to the blood of Joseph Joestar!

*poteżny gej wampir sie podnosi*



DIO: Joseph's blood suits me well. It suits this body so perfectly, my strenght is recovering

faster than ever before!

DIO: It suits me.. It truly suits me!

*AHHASHDahsdhsdhshahsdhahahahhahahahahHahHahhh, drapanie glowy*



DIO: This body belonged to Jonathan Joestar one hundred years ago. The blood that I just drank was

from his grandson, Joseph! And the one who allowed me to make it this far was you, Jotaro.

DIO: The Joestar bloodline was mere dog shit on the road that is my destiny, just something

lying in my way.. But in the end, it appears that the Joestars are fated to be my tools.

*huehueheuhehahehehahehehauheehhahaha*



JOTARO: O-Old man.. O-Old man.



JOSEPH GHOST: No matter.. No matter what Dio is about to do to my body down below, you must never get enraged and

lose your cool, Jotaro. Don't worry about me anymore. This happened because it had to happen.



JOTARO: Is this.. the old man's soul?



JOSEPH GHOST: Kakyoin solved the mystery of Dio's Stand. I relayed his message to you. If we had all

fought Dio at once, we would have all perished instantly. You've become able to move a bit within stopped time.

You have two or three seconds now.. Use that time wisely. No matter what Dio does now, you mustn't get angry.

JOSEPH GHOST: If you fly into a rage and strike first, you'll only put yourself in a bad situation.

JOSEPH GHOST: Jotaro.. This trip was truly fun, wasn't it? So much happened. I swear.. These fifty

days really were fun.

*gif jak trzyma sie za czapke i rozplywa w powietrzu*



JOTARO: Was I seeing things?



DIO: Hey! Where are you looking, Jotaro?

*sucks all blood from Joseph*



JOTARO: B-Bastard..



DIO: Now he's just an empty shell!



JOTARO: The old man told me not get angry, no matter what.

JOTARO: But that's not possible.

JOTARO: No one could stay calm after seeing that!



DIO: This is the final round!

* i tutaj skacza do siebie (jotaro i dio w formie potenznego geja wampira)



DIO: ZA WARUDO! TOKI WO TOMARE!

DIO: WRYYYYYYYYYYYY!

*wryyyy*



DIO: One second has passed!

DIO: Two seconds have passed..

DIO: Three seconds have passed!

DIO: Four seconds..

DIO I JOTARO: ORA ORA OROARORAOROAOMODUDMADUADMADUADMAUDADMADUASDMAUDADCHUJ

*jotaro rozpierdala dio dłon*



JOTARO: ORAORAORAORA



DIO: Five seconds have passed.

DIO: Six seconds have passed.

*dio regeneruje dlon*



DIO: Seven seconds have passed! I still feel the power!

DIO: I can still keep it up! By the way, Jotaro. You shouldn't be able to move any longer.

You probably gambled on the two seconds before time starts to move again, but you've miscalculated.

DIO: What a truly magnificent feeling! I feel so good, I could break out into song!

DIO: Eight seconds have passed! One hundred years ago, I attained immortality, but i didn't feel as absolutely wonderful

then as i do now!

*dio hahahaheheheh xd jak zawsze i napierdalanie palcem w skroni*



DIO: Joestar blood suits me so very well! This is the greatest high!



*jotaro mozg- O-Old man.. You were right. Getting mad has gotten me into trouble. But this isn't the end of it.

I still have plenty more rage to hurl at him!



DIO: Nine seconds have passed! I've stopped time for nine seconds!

DIO: But it appears that stopping time for nine seconds is my current limit.



JOTARO: Y-You bastard...



DIO: WRYYYYYY

*uderza jotaro łamiąc mu w chuj kości*



DIO: Now to unleash all of my Stand's power! Jotaro! You said something about being pissed off.. But your fury can

achieve no more than that!

DIO: MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA!

DIO: MUDA!

*jotaro uderza o most*



DIO: And now, without pause, my final attack! The last and final time I will stop time!

DIO: Within my nine seconds of stopped time, I shall end this!

DIO: ZA WARUDO!

*dio ląduje na moście przed jotaro i się uśmiecha*



DIO: One second has passed.

DIO: Two seconds have passed.

DIO: Three seconds have passed.

|lektor mozna powiedziec| * for some reason, dio disappeared while time was stopped.*



DIO: Four seconds have passed.

|lektor mozna powiedziec| * However, Jotaro has abandoned thought. No matter what Dio has planned,

or what attack he might unleash in the two seconds that Jotaro can move within stopped time, all he needs

to do is drive Star Platinum's fists into him in those two seconds!



DIO: Five seconds have passed.



*jotaro mozg- The one thing that I know, Dio, is that he next time I see your face, I'm probably going to bust a vein!



DIO: Six seconds have passed.



*jotaro mozg- Bring it on, Dio!



DIO: Seven seconds have passed.

DIO: ROADO ROLLA DA!

*dio pizga w jotaro zoltym walcem*

*jotaro YHASYYASHYYH YHHY YHH*



JOTARO: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA

*spam ora ogolnie*



DIO: It's too late! You cannot escape!

DIO: MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA!

*tutaj spam ora i muda na chacie *



DIO: Eight seconds have passed! WRYYYYY

DIO: I'll smash you flat!

*jotaro get smashed.png*



DIO: Nine seconds have passed.

DIO: I did it.

DIO: This proves that no one can surpass DIO!

DIO: Puny humands! I shall rule you all!

DIO: Bow before my knowledge and might!

DIO: Ten seconds have passed! Now my ability to stop time has reached ten seconds!

DIO: Now, then.. I guess I should find Jotaro's lifeless body and drink his blood. If there's any blood

left to take!

*wystraszonydio.png*



DIO: Wh-What? My body's movements a-are slowing down.. N-No.. I'm not slowing down..

I-I cannot move. I-Impossible! M-my b-body won't move at all!



JOTARO: DIO!

JOTARO: It's been eleven seconds. I guess that's your limit now.



DIO: NANI?!



JOTARO: I stopped time at the nine second mark. That let me escape.

JOTARO: Yare yare daze.

JOTARO: Now.. It won't take even a second to finish you off!

*jotaro stojacy za dio z palcem w jego strone bo to zajebiscie wyglada*



DIO: J-Jotaro! I-Impossible! You stopped time? Right at the end of my nine seconds of movement..



JOTARO: How does it feel, Dio?

JOTARO: Having someone approach from behind while you can't move a muscle, if i had to describe it, is like when a guy

who can hold his breath underwater for a minute finally comes up for air at the very last second..

JOTARO: When suddenly, he feels someone grab him, and he's dragged back down into the water.

JOTARO: Does that sound right?

JOTARO: But for you, i feel no pity at all.

JOTARO: ORA!

JOTARO: Time has begun to move again.

*dio wykrecone nogi jotaro stoi przed nim*



JOTARO: I don't feel even the slightest bit of compassion for you.

JOTARO: I haven't even an ounce of pity for you. However, just finishing you off by beating you

to death now would leave a bad taste in my mouth.

JOTARO: How many seconds will it take for your legs to recover?

JOTARO: Three seconds? Four?

JOTARO: The moment you've healed, I'll throw Star Platinum at you. So bring it on!

JORARO: If I were a gunslinger in a Western, I'd say.. ,,Draw. Let's see who's the fastest

gun in the West.''

*dio's head- H-he's.. mocking me! But.. But, Jotaro.. You may have come this far, but you are still only human.*



DIO: HahahahaAHha

*dio's head- You think like a human, who has so little time to live. About things leaving a bad taste in

mouth, or living your life with no regrets.. That kind of reasoning is about as comperlling

as rat shit in a bathroom, and it will be your demise! HahhahAhhaha!*

*dio's head- I, Dio, have no such thoughts. Within my mind is but one simple thought.*

*dio's head- Just one! To be victorious and rule! That is all.*

*dio's head- That is all i need to feel satisfaction!*

DIO: How I do it..

DIO: .. does not matter!

*wali krew w oczy jotaro*



DIO: How do you like being blinded by blood?!

DIO: I've won! Die!



JOTARO: ORA!

*rozpierdala noge The World*



DIO: Wha.. WHAT?!

*dio zostaje rozrywany przez moc Star Platinum zaraz po pierdolnięciu w noge*



DIO: I-Impossible.. I-I'm DIO..
